Hello! 

My name is Datu, and I am a PhD candidate at The Ohio State University's [School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.osu.edu/). I am a field geologist by training with 'enough' experience in isotope geochemistry. Sometimes, I also pretend to be a geochemical modeler, by crunching a lot of numbers and making pretty figures using python (or matlab, but mostly python).

## Research
My research interest lies at the intersection between geology (*sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry*) and paleoclimatology. Spesifically, I am interested in investigating the relative importance of various geologic processes in controlling changes in global climate in multi-million-years time scale.

For my PhD project I am investigating the role of tectonic processes that took place during the Ordovician Period (~487-443 Ma) in causing planetary-scale changes, which includes climate cooling, oxygenation, and biodiversification.
